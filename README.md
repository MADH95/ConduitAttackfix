# Conduit Attack Fix
Fix for attack conduits in act 1

Huge thanks to Aaron for writing the IL code and to Blind, the Bound Demon for the icon <3

This mod allows you to use the conduit buff sigils from act 2 & 3 in act 1.

**Note:** This doesn't add the art for existing sigils, for that, install [SigilArtFix](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/SigilArtPatch/)
